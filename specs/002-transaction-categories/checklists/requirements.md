# Specification Quality Checklist: Transaction Categories and Types

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

**Findings**:
- All mandatory sections are complete and well-structured
- 5 user stories prioritized (P1-P5) with independent test criteria
- 33 functional requirements organized by domain area
- 9 edge cases identified
- 9 measurable success criteria defined
- All success criteria are technology-agnostic
- No implementation details present in spec
- Assumptions clearly documented

**Notes**:
- Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- User stories are independently testable with clear priorities
- Migration strategy (US5) appropriately deprioritized
- Categories are foundational (P1) which correctly gates other features
